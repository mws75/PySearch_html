# PySearch_html
<h1>READ ME - PySearch</h1>

User inputs a keyword, and python scrapes through your html docs retrieving text from table rows that match.

In order to use, you must have a folder named "Search_Results" in the same folder as you Python script
You may need to play around with path names in order to get this to work, as it currently is was designed specificaly for my project. My next steps will be to create a more robust verion that works regardless of file tree organization.
